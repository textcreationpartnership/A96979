            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before them.</p>
            <p>And now M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to addreſſe my ſelfe to the buſineſſe, whereof I ſhall not ſpeake as a Lawyer, for I have no head for Law, neither ſhall I need to touch upon any point thereof, nor as a flouriſhing Orator, as deſirous to heare himſelfe ſpeake, I have long ſince laid aſide my bookes of Rhethorick: my deſire is, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> to tread in the ſteps of an old Divine, of whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen</hi> writes in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, who groaning under the like heavie burthen and accuſation as I doe, choſe rather to vent his owne ſenſe, and expreſſe the truth of his cauſe in plaine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, than to colour or cloak falſhood, and to extenuate his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112302:3"/> by forced, trapped, and new varniſhed eloquence: And to that purpoſe my conceptions and narration ſhall ſtand only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two feet, Negation, and Affirmation. There are ſome things that I muſt deny, and yet juſtly, ſomewhat I muſt affirme, and that I ſhall doe ingenuouſly and fully. Firſt for the Negative, I never framed, made, nor contrived, compiled, or preferred any ſuch Petition or Proteſtation, I never was at any meeting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, or conference, about any ſuch buſineſſe; nay, I never heard of any intention, much leſſe execution of any ſuch thing, untill it was the Wedneſday in Chriſtmas, being the 29. of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, at which time it was brought unto my houſe in Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden, being betwixt 6. or 7. at night (ſubſcribed by eleven of my Brethren) with a requeſt, that I would ſubſcribe ſuddenly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And for the affirmation, preſuming that ſo many learned, grave, and wiſe men, well verſt in matters of that nature, would not have attempted any ſuch thing, without good counſell to the endangering of themſelves, and their Brethren, and to the diſtaſte of the Lords, and that all the reſt of the Biſhops in or about the Citie of London, Weſtminſter, ſhould ſubſcribe thereunto, and that it ſhould not be preferred, without the approbation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation of good counſell, and of us all: I made the twelfth and ſet to my hand, which I doe now acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never denyed; nay, the firſt time that I came to the Barre in the Lords Houſe, I acknowledged that my hand was to it, and divers of this honourable Preſence heard it ſo read unto them, out of the jornall of the Lords houſe:</p>
            <p>Now Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> if theſe my deceived and deceiving thoughts (to uſe S. <hi>Bernards</hi> phraſe) have led mee into an errour, the errour is either <hi>Ex ignorantia juris,</hi> an unskilfulneſſe in the Law, or <hi>Debilitate judicii,</hi> a weakneſſe of my apprehenſion, or elſe, <hi>Ex nimia credulitate,</hi> out of the to much confidence in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not of any prepenſed malice, or out of a ſpirit of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the Lord knoweth. The Schoolemen tell me, that <hi>Duo ſunt in omni peccato,</hi> there is <hi>actio, &amp; malitia actionis,</hi> I owne the action, the ſubſcription is mine; but, that there was any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the action (to croſſe any Vote, at which I was not preſent, nor never heard of) I utterly diſavow.</p>
            <p>And therefore, Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I ſhall become an humble Sutor, that I may recommend three moſt humble Requeſts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112302:3"/> or motions to this Honourable Houſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt Motion is, That you would be pleaſed to tread in the ſteps of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Chriſtian Emperour, who had ever this reſolution, that if he ſhould ſee <hi>Sacerdotem peccantem,</hi> an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Divine, hee would rather caſt his purple garment upon him, than to reveale the offence, for the Goſpels ſake of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Motion is, That if my ſubſcription ſhall make mee a delinquent, and worthy of any cenſure, that then the cenſure may not exceed (but at the higheſt) bee proportionable to the offence.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt motion is, That, that of <hi>Plautus</hi> (after my fifty eight yeares painefull, conſtant, and ſucceſſefull preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt, in the kingdome of England, and in forraigne parts, may not be verrified of me, <hi>Si quid bene feceris levior pluma gratia eſt; ſi quid mali feceris plumbeas iras gerunt.</hi> And now (Maſter <hi>Speaker)</hi> I might here tender divers motions to the conſideration of this honourable Houſe, for favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of my raſh ſubſcription, I may ſay commiſeration, but all without oſtentation, that is farre from me, but rather for the conſolation of my perplexed ſoule, for the great affliction, reſtraint and diſgrace, which I have long ſuſtained (which is farre greater than ever I endured before, and tranſcends the dangers and jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardies of the ſeas,, and the miſeries of the warres, whereof I have had my ſhare) and partly for the vindication of my former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, calling, and profeſſion, which is now ſo clouded, ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed, and blackt in the eyes of the world, and ſcandalized in the mouths of the vulgar multitude, that without reparation, and reſtauration to my former eſteeme, I ſhall never have heart to ſhew my face in Pulpit any more, wherein I have wiſhed to end my dayes. But I wave them all, becauſe I will not detaine you from other occaſions of greater importance, and deſire my wayes may be made knowne unto you, rather by inquiſition, than my owne Relation, only I ſhall appeale to the Noble Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Dioceſſe where I now live, and of the other wherein formerly I did live, as namely the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> which I can never name without that title, not only in reſpect of their pietie, unitie, and conformity, but alſo in reſpect of their love, kindneſſe, and extraordinarie bountie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I appeale to them for their teſtimonies, and knowledge of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112302:4"/> my courſes amongſt them, nay I appeale to the records of the honourable houſe, where I am confident after ſixteene moneths ſitting, there is nothing found that can trench upon me, neither I hope will, or may bee.</p>
            <p>And therefore my humble ſuite is for expedition (if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend accuſation, or rather for your meditation, that I may ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily returne to my owne home and Cure, to redeeme the time becauſe the dayes are evill, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, and to regaine the eſteem and reputation which I was long in getting, and long injoyed, but loſt in a moment, for if I ſhould out-live (I ſay not my Biſhoprick,) but my credit, my gray haires, and many yeares, would ſoone be brought with ſorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p>I have done Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> and there remaines nothing now but that I become a petitioner unto almighty God, that he will be pleaſed to beſtow upon you all the Patriarkes bleſſing, even the dew of Heaven, and fatneſſe of the earth: and I end with that of S. <hi>Iude,</hi> Mercy, peace, and love be multiplyed unto you; I ſay againe with a religious and affectionate heart, Mercy, peace, and love, be multi-plyed unto you.</p>
